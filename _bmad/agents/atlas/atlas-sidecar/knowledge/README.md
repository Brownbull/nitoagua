# Atlas Knowledge Base

This folder contains supplementary reference materials for Atlas.

## Purpose

While `atlas-memory.md` contains the synthesized, actively-used knowledge, this folder can hold:

- Reference documents Atlas frequently needs
- Templates for seed data generation
- Use case documentation templates
- Workflow chain diagrams
- Any supporting materials that enhance Atlas's capabilities

## Structure

```
knowledge/
├── README.md              # This file
├── workflow-chains/       # Mapped user journeys (when created)
├── seed-templates/        # Seed data script templates (when created)
└── use-cases/             # Generated use case documentation (when created)
```

## Usage

Atlas references this folder for:
- Template structures when generating seeds
- Historical use case documentation
- Workflow chain visualizations

## Maintenance

This folder grows as Atlas generates artifacts:
- Seed scripts document their target use cases here
- Workflow chains are mapped as they're discovered
- Templates evolve based on project patterns
