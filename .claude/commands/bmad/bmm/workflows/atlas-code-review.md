---

Load the workflow definition from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-code-review/workflow.yaml` and execute the instructions from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-code-review/instructions.xml`.

This is an Atlas-enhanced version of code-review that includes:
- Architecture validation against Section 4 decisions
- Workflow chain validation against Section 3 user flows
- Pattern compliance against Section 5 testing patterns
- Memory feeding for lessons learned
- Push alerts on architectural drift

Execute the workflow steps in order, consulting Atlas memory where indicated.
