description: "Generate and execute persona-driven E2E tests using Atlas knowledge of user workflows, personas, and acceptance criteria to create tests that simulate real user behavior"
---

Load the workflow definition from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-e2e/workflow.yaml` and execute the instructions from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-e2e/instructions.xml`.

This is an Atlas-enhanced E2E testing workflow that includes:
- Persona analysis using Section 3 for realistic test scenarios
- Workflow chain testing for complete user journeys
- Acceptance criteria to test case mapping
- Behavioral testing based on user patterns
- Memory feeding to capture new test patterns

Execute the workflow steps in order, consulting Atlas memory where indicated.
